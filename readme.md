<p align="center"># The Story of an Engineer Who Listened to His Systems</p>

## ⌨️ Ctrl + Me - > “I build systems that work — and stories that stay.”

- **Name** — Srinivas Nagaraja  
- **Education** — MS in Information Technology, University of Cincinnati  
- **Experience** — 5 YOE

## 🧠 System.Understanding(Srinivas)

- I believe systems should feel **alive** — not just functional  
- I'm here not just to build what works — I'm here to build what **lasts**  
- Every dashboard I've built carries a small story

## 🏗️ The Architecture That Built Me

### ☁️ Cloud Platforms — The Sky I Architect In

- **AWS** taught me to build fast — To think ahead.  
- **Azure** taught me to build right, not just big.  
- **vSphere** taught me to stay grounded — cloud still runs on metal.  
- I design systems that breathe — elastic, secure, and cost-aware.

---

### 🔁 CI/CD Pipelines — My Poetry in Motion

- **Jenkins** taught me how to make things work *(Fixing was learning)*  
- **Azure DevOps** taught me how to make them work well — and stay that way *(Designing was prevention)*  
- When a build fails, I don’t panic — I listen. Failures talk if you’re patient.  
- Pipelines fail like people: when they’re misunderstood.

---

### 🧱 Infrastructure as Code — Automation That Thinks

- **Terraform** gave me freedom — one language for every cloud.  
- **CloudFormation** taught me to respect boundaries.  
- For me, IaC is storytelling in syntax — every line describing order in chaos.  
- I don't spin servers — I declare them.

---

### 📊 Monitoring & Observability — The Pulse Beneath Everything

- Every system speaks — I make sure I can hear it.  
- **Prometheus** taught me to ask the right questions, not chasing every metric.  
- **Grafana** taught me numbers mean nothing until you make them speak.  
- **Zabbix** taught me to configure, **CloudWatch** to care, and **Splunk** to understand.  
- When something fails silently, my dashboards shout first.

---

### 🐳 Containerization & Configuration Management — Build with Care

- Containers keep it light, configuration keeps it right.  
- **Docker** taught me simplicity.  
- **Puppet** taught me consistency — it’s not about deploying once, it’s about staying right every time.  
- **Kubernetes** isn’t about running containers, it’s about teaching them how to live together.

---

## 🧪 What I’ve Built (Quietly, Consistently)

- Automated VM provisioning on VMware vSphere using Jenkins, Terraform, and Packer — reducing provisioning time by 70%  
- Built golden image pipelines embedding security baselines  
- Enforced CIS compliance using Puppet Enterprise  
- Migrated hybrid .NET applications to Azure Web Apps  
- Designed reliable CI/CD pipelines teams trust during releases  
- Implemented observability stacks that detect issues before users do  
- Delivered $500K+/year in cloud cost optimization  

---

## 🤖 What I’m Exploring Now

Automation is powerful.  
But intelligent automation is the future.

I’m increasingly drawn toward:
- AIOps  
- Predictive monitoring  
- Self-healing systems  
- Data-driven operational decisions  

I want systems that don’t just run —  I want systems that **understand themselves**.

---

## ➕ Me++

- I’ll stop here — after all, even the best scripts need an `exit 0`.  
- **More about me?** Let’s save that for the post-deployment review.
