## 🌱 My Story (Why Cloud & DevOps)

Never would I have imagined that a simple curiosity about how things deploy *behind the scenes* would grow into a deep passion for **cloud infrastructure and automation**.

Early on, I found myself far more interested in:
- how systems **scale under load**
- how **pipelines orchestrate releases**
- and what makes infrastructure **resilient, observable, and secure**

That curiosity pulled me deep into **Cloud and DevOps Engineering**.  
Over time, I began building entire systems — from **provisioning infrastructure** to **automating deployments**, enforcing **security baselines**, and ensuring **high availability** across environments.

One of my most rewarding moments was connecting **frontend, backend, and databases seamlessly** — locally and insuring on **Azure Web Apps** — watching complex systems behave as one. I genuinely enjoy that feeling.

Today, I work at the intersection of **automation, reliability, and intelligence**, with a growing interest in **AIOps** — making systems not just automated, but *aware*.

## 🧠 What I Do (In Practice)

- Design **Infrastructure as Code** that is repeatable, secure, and scalable  
- Build **CI/CD pipelines** that teams trust during releases  
- Automate cloud operations to reduce toil and cost  
- Engineer **observability-first platforms**  
- Apply **SRE principles** to real-world systems

## 🤖 Where I’m Headed

Beyond automation, I’m deeply interested in **AIOps** —  
systems that can **observe, predict, and self-heal**.

I’m driven to explore the future of:
- intelligent cloud platforms  
- resilient distributed systems
